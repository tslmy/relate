## Behind the Scenes

At its core, Relate is a Python-driven [web app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) that uses the [Wikidata API](https://www.wikidata.org/w/api.php) to fetch entity properties as [edges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#edge) on a [graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#graph). 

A script explores this graph in a [breadth-first search][bfs] manner with two scrapers from both vertices specified by the user. Once scrapers meet at a vertice, a [path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#path) is found.
